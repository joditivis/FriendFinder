# About:
University of Denver Coding Boot Camp 13th week assignment: This assigmnet required us to create a Friend Finder App using Express and Node.js

# How it works:
```
- Friend Finder is an application for finding a friend with like-minded interests.
- The user will fill out a short 10 question survey, their answers will then be compared to another user's and it will return to them their name and photo of their closest friend match.
```
